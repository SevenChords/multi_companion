# multi_companion

A 'simple' companion for some games i like.
Written in python, intended to run on a Raspberry Pi with only a numpad as input method (requires a cli interface and creating a way to auto-start main.py on user login, optionally auto-pull from the main branch from github for automatic updates before launching).

The features of the companion vary from game to game, but usually focus on stuff like stat tracking and/or dynamic strategy recommendations.
